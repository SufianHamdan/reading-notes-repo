# What is Text Editor?

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site.

- I learned about text editor and the how can we choose the best text editor to use.
- We can choose the best text editor we need by knowing the most important features like:

1. code completion. 
2. syntax highlighting.
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue).
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

   You might findsome other. features that are must-haveâ€™s, but I think these features are a good start.
    
- I also learned about Terminal and some basic command lines.

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system.
You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

-The Commands that i have learned is:

* pwd >> It tells you what your current or present working directory is.
* ls >> What's in Our Current Location.
* ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory.
* . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory.
* .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory.
* cd Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
* file obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* ls -a List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.

-There is also a shortcuts that help you using command line:

*You can traverse history of your commands using the up and down arrow keys.
*Tab Completion (to complete your command when you are typing)
