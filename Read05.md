# JavaScript-JQuery
### HTML ONLY 
- Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site:
  its content.
- Being plain HTML, this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be accessible to all
  users, and load quite quickly on slow connections.
---

### HTML+CSS

- Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks
  away from the content itself.

- You can use the same style sheet with all of your site, making your sites faster
  to load and easier to maintain.
- Or you can use different style sheets with the same content to create different
  views of the same data.

### HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT

- The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of
  the page or the experience of interacting with the site.
- Keeping it separate mean that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the
  JavaScript.
- You can also reuse the code on severa l pages (making the site faster to load
  and easier to maintain).
