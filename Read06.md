# Computers

### What is Computer and how it work?

- A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data.
- 
### It goes into four categories: 

1. Input 
* Mouse
* Keyboard
* Mic
* etc
---

2. Storage
* All the input stored in the computer memory.

4. Processing
* The computer processor takes the information from the memory and changes it using algorithim which its aseries of commands and send the processed information back
 to the memory to be stored again.
5. Output
* Out can be text, images, videos, games or Virtual reality.


### How computer works?
- Computer works in ones and zeroes.
- Inside a computer there is an electric wires and circutes carries out all the information in the computer.
- Throughout wire computer can get data by 1 or 0 and we can call them bit so if its one we can store a piece of informtaion.
- So more wires more bits that can represnt complex info.
- Binery number system we can represnt anything we like including text, images, sound, etc.

### Circuits and logic

- Not Circuits : if we give it a 1 the out will be 0 or if we give it a 0 the output will be 1.
- And Circuits: it need to bits and the out can be 1 only if the bits are 1's.

- Adder Circuits can add 2 bits and we can combine multible adder Circuits to calculate a larg number.
- There is also a subtraction and multiplication Circuits.

### Hardware and Software

Hardware can be :
* Speakers
* Circuits
* Wires
* Plugs
* Chips

### Software can be : 
* Apps
* Games
* Websites
